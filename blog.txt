# Hands-on Example for Creating Small Language Models: The Future of Efficient AI

## Introduction

As we move into 2025, while large language models continue to dominate headlines, there's a growing movement toward smaller, more efficient models. These Small Language Models (SLMs) are proving that bigger isn't always better, especially when it comes to practical applications and accessibility.

## Why Small Language Models?

1. **Resource Efficiency**: SLMs can run smoothly on standard laptops and mobile devices without requiring expensive GPU infrastructure.

2. **Lower Costs**: Training and deploying smaller models is significantly more cost-effective than their larger counterparts.

3. **Faster Inference**: With fewer parameters to process, SLMs can provide quicker responses, making them ideal for real-time applications.

4. **Environmental Impact**: Smaller models require less computational power, resulting in a reduced carbon footprint.

5. **Focused Expertise**: SLMs can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, often matching or exceeding the performance of larger models in specialized domains.

## Hands-on Example

Let's explore a practical example of creating a Small Language Model for English to Marathi translation. This demonstrates the real-world application of SLMs in language translation tasks.
